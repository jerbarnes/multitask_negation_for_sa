Sentiment analysis is directly affected by _compositional phenomena_ in language that act on the prior polarity of the words and phrases found in the text. __Negation__ is the most prevalent of these phenomena and in order to correctly predict sentiment, a classifier must be able to identify negation and disentangle the effect that its scope has on the final polarity of a text. This paper proposes a multi-task approach to explicitly incorporate information about negation in sentiment analysis, which we show outperforms learning negation implicitly in a data-driven manner. We describe our approach, a __cascading neural architecture with selective sharing of LSTM layers__, and show that explicitly training the model with negation as an auxiliary task helps improve the main task of sentiment analysis. The effect is demonstrated across several different standard English-language datasets for both tasks and we analyze several aspects of our system related to its performance, varying types and amounts of input data and different multi-task setups.
